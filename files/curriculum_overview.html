      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School, we believe children are unique individuals
        with their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and
        physical development. We support and encourage this growth through a child-centered,
        process-oriented, play-based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and
        practices, guided by educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky,
        DeVries, and others.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classroom experiences are structured around ideas and topics relevant to students, with knowledge built through language, discussion, experimentation, and meaningful materials.</li>
        <li>Hands-on learning uses a variety of materials, engages multiple senses, and encourages exploration and investigation.</li>
        <li>Each child is allowed to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, individually, with a partner, or in larger groups.</li>
        <li>Teachers ask open-ended questions, allow time for thoughtful responses, listen respectfully, and gently guide children as reasoning skills develop.</li>
        <li>Students' ideas are respected, independent thinking is encouraged, and children are empowered to become problem solvers.</li>
        <li>Our diverse, multi-cultural community is used to highlight similarities and differences among individuals, families, and cultures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Washington University Nursery School's open curriculum framework is developmentally
        appropriate and based on the philosophy that children learn most effectively through
        play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art,
        writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy while planning
        for each child's social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs.

      <p>
        Language grows through conversation, storytelling, songs, dramatic play,
        early word recognition, and children dictating and writing their own stories.
