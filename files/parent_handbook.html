          <h3>Orientation Day:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the
            child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet
            the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow
            time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a
            brief overview of what to expect during the school year. The next
            day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or
            Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half,
            attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the
            children and teachers to interact with a small group before the
            entire class attends on Friday.

          <h3>Parent-Staff Communication:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the
            school website and emails give you information on current themes,
            activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by
            classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations
            and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a
            teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers
            can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Student Assessment:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with
            children in their play, conversations and observations both in the
            classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each
            child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their
            development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples
            of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly
            to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to
            enhance needed skills for children.

          <h3>Parent-Teacher Conferences:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            The school has two
            Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an
            informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The
            spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A
            parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the
            year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.

          <h3>Parking:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These
            three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school
            day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3
            parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit
            should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located
            off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is
            $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide
            validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special
            school events.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Drop-Off and Pick-Up:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            All traffic for arrival and dismissal must proceed from the parking
            lot entrance west of the school, driving east and stopping at the
            school entrance. Drivers stay in their cars and teachers help the
            children enter and exit. Teachers are outside for arrival of
            children at 8:50 a.m. for the morning session and 12:30 p.m. for the
            afternoon session. At no time should your child be allowed to exit
            your car without a teacher present. If you arrive late, you must
            escort your child to the classroom. At dismissal (11:45 a.m. and
            3:15 p.m.) children assemble outside the front door on benches or,
            in inclement weather, inside the front door. The teachers bring
            children to their cars. No child can be dismissed to anyone other
            than persons designated (in writing) by the parents. Your child must
            hold hands with a teacher or parent when in front of the school in
            the drop-off/pick-up area.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Inclement Weather:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            The nursery school, as a department within Washington University,
            follows the university policy for school closings as a result of
            inclement weather. It is university policy that faculty and staff
            members should report to work and leave work at their regularly
            scheduled times. Should weather conditions create potentially
            hazardous travel, the vice chancellor for human resources will
            evaluate the severity of the situation and, in consultation with the
            executive vice chancellors, determine the appropriate measures to be
            taken. Factors to be considered will include the safety of our
            faculty, staff and students as well as the services that must be
            provided despite the severe weather. In the event that the decision
            is made to dismiss employees early, the staff of the Office of Human
            Resources will contact the various executive vice chancellors, vice
            chancellors and deans, who, in turn, will be responsible for
            communicating this decision to faculty and staff members. A nursery
            school staff member would then relay that decision to the parent
            community via phone and/or email.

          <h3>Health Policy:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
            The nursery school makes a great effort to provide a healthy
            environment for your children. If children become ill at school,
            they will be cared for in the office until a parent can pick them
            up.
          </p>

          <p>
            Parents are requested to keep their child home in the event of the
            diseases or symptoms noted below. The child will be allowed to
            return to school when he or she has been
            <strong
              >free of these symptoms and has not required medication for a
              minimum of 24 hours</strong
            >. If a symptom persists (such as rash or cough), or if a
            communicable disease is confirmed (measles, chicken pox, etc.),
            returning to school may require a statement from the child’s
            physician declaring that the condition is no longer contagious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>PLEASE CALL</strong> the nursery school to inform us that
            your child is sick, especially if he/she has a communicable disease.
            In turn, we will send a letter home to inform parents that your
            child has been exposed to a communicable disease.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Medication, Allergies, & Accidents:</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />
          <p>
    <strong>Medication:</strong> The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at home and not at school.
The nursery school staff does not routinely administer medications to the children. Also, we
do not apply sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that absolutely needs to be
administered during school hours must be cleared with the director.
  </p>
   <p>
   <strong>Allergies:</strong> If your child has a known allergic reaction, this must be documented on the child’s History
and Health Record kept in his/ her file in the office. Also, please report these allergies to the
classroom teachers. For your child’s safety, these allergies will be posted in your child’s
classroom. If you object to this information being posted, please contact the director. In case
of severe allergies such as to bee stings or nuts, an EpiPen Injector Kit may be kept at the
nursery school and used by the director and/or teachers who are trained in its
administration. This is stored in the emergency backpack in the child’s classroom. Each
classroom has a First Aid Kit that includes the EpiPen (if required). This, along with
emergency medical forms for every child, accompanies the classes on all walking or driving
field trips.
  </p>
    <p>
   <strong>Peanut and Tree Nut Policy:</strong> Washington University Nursery School will be a
peanut- and tree nut-free (Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, and
hazelnuts) preschool beginning with the 2017-2018 school year.
  </p>
      <p>
   <strong>Accidents:</strong> Should a
serious accident occur, a parent is immediately contacted. If parents and emergency contacts
cannot be reached, we will take your child to the hospital designated on your enrollment
form. Minor injuries will be reported to you by your child’s teacher at pick-up. All injuries
will also be reported in written form and given to you at pickup time. We will ask you to sign
an identical form to be placed in your child’s file at school.
  </p>
  <br />
