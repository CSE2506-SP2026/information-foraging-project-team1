      <h3>Extra Help</h3>
      <p>
        Teachers observe and assess children's progress on an ongoing basis and adapt curriculum experiences to meet students' needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child's thinking, build trust, and increase confidence.</li>
        <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration.</li>
        <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli.</li>
        <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration.</li>
        <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials.</li>
        <li>Planning individual, small-group, and large-group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Conferences</h3>
      <p>
        Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (fall and spring). Teachers document student activities throughout the year to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs, and communicate with families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fall conferences are informal and focus on classroom progress and questions. Spring conferences are more formal and include assessment information across curriculum areas, shared with families in advance of the meeting.
